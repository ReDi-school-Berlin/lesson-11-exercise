#NOTE: Try using f-strings wherever you can 

  
  
# Exercise 1:
# Try displaying the following dictionary using the three formatting methods (%, str.format() and f-string)
# So the output would be something like this: Hi I am Tim and I am a gardener.
 name="Tim"
 occupation="gardener"









# Exercise 2:
# Write a python program to check whether a given integer is a multiple of 5 or not
# hint: Use the %(modulo operator) and if else statements.










# Exercise 3
# Input two numbers and write a program to check which one of the two is the largest. 
# For example: 24 and 45---> 45 is the larger number
# hint: Use if else statements and 'input' to get values from the user.









# Exercise 4
# Write a program to calculate the average of a set of given integers.
# For example: if integer=5 then 1+2+3+4+5/5 would output 3.0, remember to add numbers exclusive of 0 and inclusive of the integer value
# hint: use loops to calculate the sum of the numbers and use the formula avergae=sum_of_numbers/total_numbers










# Exercise 5
# Can you draw the following pattern.
#     *
#     * *
#     * * *
#     * * * *
#     * * * * *
# hint: use nested loops









# Exercise 6
# Can you make the same pattern in reverse
#     * * * * * 
#     * * * * 
#     * * * 
#     * * 
#     * 
  









# Exercise 7
# understand indexing
# tuple1[0] = 'Orange'
# tuple1[1] = [10, 20, 30]
# tuple1[2]=  [5, 15, 25]

#Access the value 20 from the tuple

tuple1 = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))






# Exercise 8
# Print characters placed at even index numbers from the string of users choice
# For example: word= REDI, index 0= R, index 2= D
# hint: use for loop and play with the step size of the range








# Exercise 9
# Swap the values of two variables x=5 and y=10
# So the output after the swapping should be x=10 and y=5
# hint: use another variable to store the value
 







# Exercise 10
# How many times does the letter 'b' appear in the string below
# hint: use the built in count() method to calculate the number of times a specified element appears.
 sentence = "Betty bought a butter but the butter was bitter so Betty bought a butter to make the bitter butter better"
